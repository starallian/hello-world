# hello-world
*This repository will be about my personal improvement about coding.
*I start programing at the age of 36 but i'm so enthusiastic about coding. 
*Despite i have a totally different background, i am eager to typing code rather than copy pasting. 
*As a result of my ongoing efforts, i decided to contribute to the open source community which is as i discovered lately.
